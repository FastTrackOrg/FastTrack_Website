title: FastAnalyzer road to beta
---

Tracking objects from video recording is generally only the first step of any scientific analysis. The second task, the trajectory analysis, can be quite daunting. Numerous tools are available, from scripting languages to complete user interface environments that require various learning curves.

FastTrack allows an easy and fast tracking from any video recording. To make the trajectory analysis as fast and easy as possible, we started the development of FastAnalyzer. FastAnalyzer is built on top of the Python scientific ecosystem (SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn) and of the existing FastAnalysis library.

The goal is to integrate the power and versatility of the Python ecosystem in an intuitive user interface tailored to process result file from FastTrack.

The road map to version alpha is as follows:
1. ~~Interface design~~
2. ~~Basic plot capability~~
3. Session managment to save and recover plots
4. Master plot theming
5. Statistical analysis

You can see below preview of the software in the current state of development.
