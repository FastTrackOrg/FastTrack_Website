title: MinGW_w64 FastTrack version
---

Since version 6.2.0, FastTrack has been compilated using MinGW_w64 instead of MSVC2019.
[MinGW_w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) is a fork of the MinGW project that provides the GCC compiler for Windows. With a "better-conforming and faster math support compared to VisualStudio's" and a pthreads library, [this compiler yields better performance](https://www.fasttrack.sh/blog/2022/01/14/Performance) for the OpenCV library and thus for FastTrack.

Compiling FastTrack using MinGW_w64 provides several improvements. First, it provides the [getopt.h](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/getopt_002eh.html) header necessary to the FastTrack-Cli. From version 6.2.0, the command line interface of FastTrack is available natively on Windows. Secondly, OpenCV compiled using [MinGW_w64 is more performant than with MSVC](https://www.fasttrack.sh/blog/2022/01/14/Performance/#results) and Qt seems more responsive. Finally, the bundle (executable plus DLLs) is lighter than its MSVC counterpart (42,7 MB vs 62.8 MB).

Compiling FastTrack using MinGW_w64 comes with some challenges. The main dependency of FastTrack is OpenCV and it does not provide pre-built binaries for MinGW_w64, therefore, we need to compile OpenCV from sources. This compilation is done one time in [this](https://github.com/FastTrackOrg/Windows_MinGW_64_OpenCV) GitHub repository and files are downloaded at compile time to save processing energy.
Conveniently, Qt provides pre-built binaries and the whole [MinGW_w64 toolchains in its archives](https://download.qt.io/online/qtsdkrepository/windows_x86/desktop/tools_mingw90/). Installing Qt and MinWG_w64 can be done very easily without external sources. The windeployqt Qt tool takes care of the DLLs (Qt and MinGW_x64) needed at runtime and the resulting bundle is very light.
MinGW_w64 version of Qt does not provide the QtWebEngine, thus, the in software documentation is not available anymore.

To conclude, MinGW_w64 version of FastTrack has better performance, a lighter footprint with only one drawback: recompile OpenCV when newer versions will be available. For developers, the environment is easier to set up with only three commands necessary.
